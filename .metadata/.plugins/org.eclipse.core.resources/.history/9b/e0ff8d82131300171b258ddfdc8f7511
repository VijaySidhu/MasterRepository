/**
 * 1) Create an empty stack and push -1
 * to it. The first element of stack is
 * used to provide base for next valid
 * string.
 * 
 * 2) Initialize result as 0.
 * 
 * 3) If the character is '(' i.e.
 * str[i] == '('), push index 'i' to the
 * stack.
 * 
 * 2) Else (if the character is ')') a)
 * Pop an item from stack (Most of the
 * time an opening bracket) b) If stack
 * is not empty, then find length of
 * current valid substring by taking
 * difference between current index and
 * top of the stack. If current length
 * is more than result, then update the
 * result. c) If stack is empty, push
 * current index as base for next valid
 * substring.
 * 
 * 3) Return result.
