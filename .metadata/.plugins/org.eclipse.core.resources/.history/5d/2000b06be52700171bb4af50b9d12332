/**
 * Depth First Traversal can be used to
 * detect cycle in a Graph. DFS for a
 * connected graph produces a tree.
 * There is a cycle in a graph only if
 * there is a back edge present in the
 * graph. A back edge is an edge that is
 * from a node to itself (selfloop) or
 * one of its ancestor in the tree
 * produced by DFS
 * 
 * To detect a back edge, we can keep
 * track of vertices currently in
 * recursion stack of function for DFS
 * traversal. If we reach a vertex that
 * is already in the recursion stack,
 * then there is a cycle in the tree.
 * The edge that connects current vertex
 * to the vertex in the recursion stack
 * is back edge. We have used recStack[]
 * array to keep track of vertices in
 * the recursion stack.
