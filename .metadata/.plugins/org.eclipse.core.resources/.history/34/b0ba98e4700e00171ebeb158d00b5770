/**
 * Sort all array elements in increasing

 * make sure that all divisors of an
 * element appear before it. Create an
 * array divCount[] of same size as
 * input array. divCount[i] stores size
 * of divisible subset ending with
 * arr[i] (In sorted array). The minimum
 * value of divCount[i] would be 1.
 * Traverse all array elements. For
 * every element, find a divisor arr[j]
 * with largest value of divCount[j] and
 * store the value of divCount[i] as
 * divCount[j] + 1.
