 *         2. Pick the smallest edge.
 *         (Use Find Union Algorithm to
 *         find cycle) Check if it forms
 *         a cycle with the spanning
 *         tree formed so far. If cycle
 *         is not formed, include this
 *         edge. Else, discard it.
 * 
 *         3. Repeat step#2 until there
 *         are (V-1) edges in the
 *         spanning tree.
