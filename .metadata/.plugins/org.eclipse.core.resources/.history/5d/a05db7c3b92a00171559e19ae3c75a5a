/**
 * Prims Algorithm
 * 
 * 1) Create a set mstSet that keeps
 * track of vertices already included in
 * MST. 2) Assign a key value to all
 * vertices in the input graph.
 * Initialize all key values as
 * INFINITE. Assign key value as 0 for
 * the first vertex so that it is picked
 * first. 3) While mstSet doesn’t
 * include all vertices ….a) Pick a
 * vertex u which is not there in mstSet
 * and has minimum key value. ….b)
 * Include u to mstSet. ….c) Update key
 * value of all adjacent vertices of u.
 * To update the key values, iterate
 * through all adjacent vertices. For
 * every adjacent vertex v, if weight of
 * edge u-v is less than the previous
 * key value of v, update the key value
 * as weight of u-v
