 * Apply Modified binary search. Like
 * normal binary search, we compare
 * given str with middle string. If
 * middle string is empty, we find the
 * closest non-empty string x (by
 * linearly searching on both sides).
 * Once we find x, we do standard binary
 * search, i.e., we compare given str
 * with x. If str is same as x, we
 * return index of x. if str is greater,
 * we recur for right half, else we
 * recur for left half.
